# mybankaccount

The web app I have built is a Banking system that includes User Signup/Login, Account, Transfer, Appointment, Transaction and User Profile.<br />

Front-end: Thymeleaf, Html/CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and some JS plugins<br />
Back-end: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Hibernate, MySQL

I have used Spring Boot to quickly prototype the web app<br />
I have developed domain classes to model the business entities<br />
I have used Spring Security for the security layer<br />
Used Spring Data, JPA and Hibernate to create the persistence layer<br />
Used Spring Boot to host REST service resources<br />
Developed frontend services to communicate with backend through REST services<br />
Used security controls to limit access with different roles
