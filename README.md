# mybankaccount

The web app I have built is a Banking system that includes User Signup/Login, Account, Transfer, Appointment, Transaction and User Profile.

Front-end: Thymeleaf, Html/CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and some JS plugins
Back-end: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security, Hibernate, MySQL

I have used Spring Boot to quickly prototype the web app
I have developed domain classes to model the business entities
I have used Spring Security for the security layer
Used Spring Data, JPA and Hibernate to create the persistence layer
Used Spring Boot to host REST service resources
Developed frontend services to communicate with backend through REST services
Used security controls to limit access with different roles
